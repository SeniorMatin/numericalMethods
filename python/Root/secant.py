    If dx is too small, the method can be swamped by round-off error 
    caused by subtractive cancellation in the denominator
    If it is too big, the technique can become inefficient and even divergent.
    However, if chosen correctly, it provides a nice alternative for cases where evaluating
    the derivative is diffi cult and developing two initial guesses is inconvenient.
